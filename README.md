I often found my friends tweets were buried by account with large amount of posts. The Twitter's home timeline is a classic example of information overload. Though some account posts a lot of usefully information, e.g. Hacker News is favorite. But in addition to Hacker News, I still want to know what my friends are talking about. The thing is, my friends won't tweet a lot. They kept quiet for a some and tweet just once in some random time. It hard to discover those tweets.

So here I created this app called **Avetuc**
